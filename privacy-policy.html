        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES. BY USING THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
        
        <p>By using the Website or Services, you accept the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy and the <a href="https://vieurl.web.app/terms-of-service.html" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a>. This privacy statement was last updated on <strong>March 10, 2020</strong>. This privacy statement was created in order to disclose its information gathering and dissemination practices for its website located at <a href="/">www.vieUrl.net</a> and other related websites owned and/or operated by vieUrl (together, the "Website"), products (for example, vieUrl Net Helper), and the services offered and provided through the Website (the <strong>"Services"</strong> as described in the <a href="https://vieurl.web.app/terms-of-service.html" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a>). </p>
        <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to provide you with clear, simple and complete information about how we process the personal data you give us or the data we may collect while you are browsing our website, how it may be transferred to third parties and your rights and options to control your personal information and protect your privacy. Accordingly, we prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern the Website and Services (the <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>). </p>
        <p>vieUrl reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes on this page. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on the Website prior to the change becoming effective, and we may also try to notify you through email of the privacy changes, if necessary. Please check the revision date below to determine if this Privacy Policy has been modified since you last reviewed it. Your continued use of any portion of the Website or Services following posting of the updated Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the changes.</p>
        <p><strong>A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
        <p><strong>How we collect your information</strong></p>
        <p>We may collect information regarding the use of our Website, especially with respect to your browsing (pages visited, links clicked, etc.). Some of this information may be collected using cookies placed in your web browser when you browse our website. The information that we request is and will be retained by us and used as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences or orientation.</p>
        <p>When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect this information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on the Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.</p>
        <p>When you use the Website, vieUrl or trusted third parties authorized by vieUrl may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby. When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to vieUrl every time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you visited, the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version that you are using to access the Website. All of this information may be collected by vieUrl and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>

        <p>vieUrl does not track users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does use do not track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your web browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.</p>
        <p>Our Website also may contain links to other third-party websites. vieUrl is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit. vieUrl may make third party applications available to you through the Website or Services. The information collected by vieUrl when you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by the provider's privacy policies.</p>
        <p><strong>We may collect your information when you:</strong><br>
        (i) create a customer account on our applications, if applicable;<br>
        (ii) contact our customer service or send requests for information to us;<br>
        (iii) browse on the Internet using cookies or similar technology.</p>
        <p><strong>vieUrl processes your information to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>enable you to create and manage your access to your customer account if applicable;</li>
          <li>connect you to external, third party applications, such as when you create an account using an external application;</li>
          <li>manage customer relations with respect to any requests for information or complaints you may send us;</li>
          <li>manage and optimize your customer experience by improving our knowledge of our customers;</li>
          <li>conduct statistical analyses to develop management, measuring and reporting tools in order to adjust and improve our services;</li>
          <li>when you have given your consent for the processing of your data and of your browsing data via cookies, etc.</li>
        </ul>

You may also register with vieUrl through your account with certain third party social networking services (collectively, <strong>"SNS"</strong>).

        <p><strong>B. COOKIE POLICY</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
        <p>The Website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. Cookies are tiny text files that are stored on our website as you browse, to help track your use of our site and to personalize your journey. If you return to the website, the server can call the information from the cookies stored on your computer to tailor your experience of the site. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. vieUrl uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. </p>
        <p>We want to make sure you are fully aware of the cookies we use and what they do on vieUrl. Our cookies serve various purposes, but are generally either necessary or essential to the functioning of our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, help us improve the performance or provide you extra functionality of the same, or help us to serve relevant and targeted advertisements. Cookies can be categorized by the purpose they serve and by whether they are considered a “First Party Cookie” or “Third Party Cookie,” which describes who manages and controls the cookie and any information it collects.</p>
        <p><strong>First Party Cookies.</strong> These are cookies that are controlled and managed by vieUrl. This means that we also have access to any data that is being collected or stored. vieUrl only uses First Party Cookies that are either Strictly Necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Party Cookies. </strong>These are cookies that are controlled and managed by a third party and they place these cookies on your device when you visit our site. Data collected, stored or used by the cookie is only accessible by the third party. We may use Third Party Cookies for each of the purposes listed below. Some may collect personally identifiable information (such as IP addresses). Some collect data in an anonymized form and aggregate statistics (such as Performance Cookies.)</p>
        <p>Please note that Third Party Cookies, which include the use of cookies by our partners, affiliates and service providers, are not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. In addition, vieUrl does not have access to any cookie-specific information collected directly by Third Party Cookies. To obtain access to or review your cookie-specific information, you will need to contact the third party as they control the cookie(s). These cookies are not essential to browsing on our website. </p>
        <p><strong>"Essential" </strong>cookies are essential for browsing on our website, especially for the functioning of the order process. Deletion of these cookies may cause problems with browsing on our website.</p>
        <p><strong>"Analysis and Customization" </strong>cookies are not essential to browsing on our website, but may help you, for example, to search more effectively and optimise your purchasing experience and help us better target your requirements, improve our offer and optimise the functioning of our website.</p>
        <p><strong>“Functional”</strong> cookies are used to provide services or to remember settings to improve your visit. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</p>
        <p><strong>“Performance”</strong> cookies do not collect any information that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how our website works, understand what interests our users and measure the effectiveness of our content. They do this by gathering statistical information, for instance, about page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. This also helps us know which pages are the most and least popular and lets us understand how visitors more around the site. The statistical data collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymous.</p>
        <p><strong>“Targeting”</strong> cookies may be set through our sites, applications, or tools by third party advertising partners. This is in order to deliver content, including product related advertisements, relevant to your specific interests on our sites or third-party sites. They may be used by these companies to build a profile of your interests so that relevant adverts can be displayed on other sites. The profiles are built based on a unique identifier that is assigned to the cookie and linked to your browser and internet device.</p>
        <p>You can set your browser software so that you are regularly asked if you wish to accept or refuse cookies before a cookie can be registered; you systematically refuse the registration of cookies. Settings vary from one type of browser software to another. Details can generally be found in your browser software help menu.
